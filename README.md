# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 
In this project I used machine learning to analyze a credit card dataset and create models that predict customer credit risk. I used several machine learning models and algorithms in an attempt to reduce bias and improve performance. In the results I will discuss the benefits of each model used and recommend whether the model should be used to predict credit risk.
 
## Results 

Balanced Accuracy Score:
The accuracy score of a model is based on the differnce between the predicted values and actual values. 

Precision Score: 
The precision score, also known as the positive predictive value, measures how likely a positive prediction is actually true. In other words, it is a measure of how reliable a positive classification is. Precision = TP/(TP+FP)

Recall Score:
A recall score, also referred to as sensitivity, is a measure of how likely all positive values will be predicted in a model. Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)

#### Model 1: Oversampling

The balanced accuracy score is .64, 

#### Model 2: SMOTE Oversampling

The balanced accuracy score is .65 

#### Model 3: Undersampling

the balanced accuracy score is .54

#### Model 4: Combinaion (Over and Under) Sampling

The balanced accuracy score is .64

#### Model 5: Ensemble Learner - Balanced Random Forest Classifier

The balanced accuracy score is .79

#### Model 6: Ensemble Learner - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

The balanced accuracy score is .93
