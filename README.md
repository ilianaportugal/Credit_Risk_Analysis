# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 
In this project I used machine learning to analyze a credit card dataset and create models that predict customer credit risk. I used several machine learning models and algorithms in an attempt to reduce bias and improve performance. In the results I will discuss the benefits of each model used and recommend whether the model should be used to predict credit risk.
 
## Results 

### Balanced Accuracy Score
The accuracy score of a model is based on the differnce between the predicted values and actual values. 

### Precision 
The precision score, also known as the positive predictive value, measures how likely a positive prediction is actually true. In other words, it is a measure of how reliable a positive classification is. 

### Recall Scores
A recall score, also referred to as sensitivity, is a measure of how likely all positive values will be predicted in a model. 

### Model 1: Oversampling

### Model 2: SMOTE Oversampling

### Model 3: Undersampling

### Model 4: Combinaion (Over and Under) Sampling

### Model 5: Ensemble Learner - Balanced Random Forest Classifier

### Model 6: Ensemble Learner - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
